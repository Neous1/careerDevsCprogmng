What’s stdint.h?

What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
A: uint8_t represents 1 unsigned bytes 
    uint32_t represents 4 unsigned bytes 
    int32_t represents 4 bytes 
    int16_t represents 2 bytes 

How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
A:
    BYTE = 1 byte;
    DWORD = 4 unsigned bytes;
    Long = 4 bytes;
    WORD = 2 unsigned bytes;

What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
A: 40 - 14 = 30 bytes

What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

What does fseek do?

A: fseek() allows you to move forward or backward within a file.

What is SEEK_CUR?
